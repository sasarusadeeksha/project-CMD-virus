**NeuroPulse** is a standalone Windows executable that unleashes a "waterfall" of system chaos:

- 🔴 Custom red error pop-ups with sound
- 🪟 Native Windows error boxes
- 💚 Green-colored Command Prompt windows running `dir /s`
- 🔊 System beeps for added effect

This project is designed for fun, demonstration, or prank use in a **safe environment** (like a virtual machine or sandbox).
